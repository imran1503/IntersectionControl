# IntersectionControl

This is our 4th year project: Intersection Control: Yellow means Go Faster!

This repository holds all of the files that were used to make progress as well as some files provided from our simulator of choice: CARLA as test files we could run and learn from.

In this repository, there are python files used for both CARLA, MATLAB RoadRunner as well as ROS packages.
